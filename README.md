# irl-lab
An implementation of popular Inverse Reinforcement Learning algorithms for various tasks.

The code in this repository is heavily inspired by [this](https://github.com/MatthewJA/Inverse-Reinforcement-Learning) work by Matthew Alger, while the idea itself (not to mention, the name) is inspired by OpenAI and UC Berkeley's [rllab](https://github.com/openai/rllab).
